#' Calculate Feature Coverage Across Genomic Intervals
#'
#' @description
#' Counts overlapping features from a target set for each interval in a query set.
#' Supports both strand-aware and strand-agnostic counting, similar to
#' `bedtools coverage`.
#'
#' @param a Query regions in any format compatible with `importBed()`:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Character vector of ranges ("chr:start-end[:strand]")
#'   \item GRanges object
#'   \item data.frame/data.table with required columns
#'   \item Path to a BED file
#' }
#' @param b Target regions in same format as `a`. These features are counted
#'   when they overlap regions in `a`.
#' @param ignore.strand Logical. If `TRUE`, counts overlaps regardless of strand.
#'   If `FALSE`, only counts features on matching strands. Default is `TRUE`.
#'
#' @details
#' **Coverage Calculation**:
#'
#' For each region in `a`:
#' - Identifies all overlapping features from `b`
#' - Counts number of distinct overlapping features
#' - Reports 0 for regions with no overlaps
#'
#' **Strand Handling**:
#'
#' - When `ignore.strand = TRUE`:
#'   * Counts all overlapping features
#'   * Useful for strand-independent analyses
#' - When `ignore.strand = FALSE`:
#'   * Only counts features on matching strands
#'   * Required for strand-specific analyses
#'
#' **Overlap Definition**:
#'
#' Features are counted if they:
#' - Share the same chromosome
#' - Have any overlap in coordinates
#' - Match strands (if `ignore.strand = FALSE`)
#'
#' @return A numeric vector where:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Length equals number of regions in `a`
#'   \item Each value represents number of overlapping features from `b`
#'   \item Values â‰¥ 0 (0 indicates no overlapping features)
#' }
