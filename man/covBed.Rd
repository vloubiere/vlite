\title{Calculate Feature Coverage Across Genomic Intervals}
\usage{
covBed(a, b, maxgap = -1L, minoverlap = 0L, ignore.strand = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Query regions in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{b}{Target regions in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{maxgap}{A single integer specifying the maximum gap allowed between 2 ranges for them to
be considered as overlapping. Default= -1.}

\item{minoverlap}{A single integer specifying the minimum overlap between 2 ranges for them to
be considered as overlapping. Default= 0.}

\item{ignore.strand}{If set to FALSE, only features that are on the same strand will be counted.
If set to TRUE (default), overlapping feature are counted irrespective of their strand.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length nrow(a) corresponding, for each region in a, to the number
of overlapping regions in b. 0 means no overlaps.
}
\description{
A wrapper around ?GenomicRanges::countOverlaps that computes, for each genomic range in a,
the number of overlapping regions in b.
}
\examples{
# Create example regions
a <- importBed(c("chr1:100-300:+", "chr1:400-500:-", "chr2:100-200:+"))
b <- importBed(c("chr1:50-150:+", "chr1:200-250:+", "chr1:400-450:-", "chr1:400-450:+", "chr3:100-200:+"))

# Count overlapping features
covBed(a, b)
covBed(a, b, ignore.strand = FALSE)
