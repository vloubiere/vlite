\title{Find Overlapping or Non-overlapping Genomic Regions}
\usage{
intersectBed(a, b, ignore.strand = TRUE, min.overlap = 1L, invert = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Query regions in any format compatible with `importBed()`:
\itemize{
  \item Character vector of ranges ("chr:start-end[:strand]")
  \item GRanges object
  \item data.frame/data.table with required columns
  \item Path to a BED file
}}

\item{b}{Target regions in same format as `a`. These regions are checked
for overlaps with regions in `a`.}

\item{ignore.strand}{Logical. If `TRUE`, finds overlaps regardless of strand.
If `FALSE`, only considers overlaps between matching strands. Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{min.overlap}{Integer or integer vector. Minimum required overlap size in
  base pairs. Can be:
\itemize{
  \item Single value: Applied to all regions
  \item Vector: Different threshold for each region in `a`
}
Default is `1L` (any overlap).}

\item{invert}{Logical. If `TRUE`, returns non-overlapping regions from `a`.
If `FALSE`, returns overlapping regions. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing:
\itemize{
  \item When `invert = FALSE`: Regions from `a` that overlap with `b`
  \item When `invert = TRUE`: Regions from `a` that don't overlap with `b`
}
Original column order and data types are preserved.
}
\description{
Identifies genomic regions that overlap (or don't overlap) between two sets,
with support for strand-specific matching and minimum overlap requirements.
Similar to `bedtools intersect`.

\details{
**Overlap Detection**:

Regions overlap if they:
- Share the same chromosome
- Have overlapping coordinates ≥ `min.overlap` bases
- Match strands (if `ignore.strand = FALSE`)

**Strand Handling**:

- When `ignore.strand = TRUE`:
  * Finds overlaps regardless of strand
  * Useful for strand-independent features
- When `ignore.strand = FALSE`:
  * Only considers overlaps between matching strands
  * Required for strand-specific analyses

**Minimum Overlap**:

- Single value: Same threshold for all regions
- Vector: Different thresholds per region
- Regions with overlap < threshold are treated as non-overlapping

\examples{
# Create example regions
query <- importBed(c(
  "chr1:100-200:+",  # Complete overlap
  "chr1:300-400:-",  # Partial overlap
  "chr1:500-600:+",  # No overlap
  "chr1:700-800:-"   # Strand-specific overlap
))

target <- importBed(c(
  "chr1:100-200:+",  # Matches first region exactly
  "chr1:350-450:+",  # Overlaps second region (different strand)
  "chr1:700-800:+"   # Overlaps fourth region (different strand)
))

# Find all overlapping regions
overlaps <- intersectBed(query, target)
print("Overlapping regions:")
print(overlaps)

# Find strand-specific overlaps
strand_overlaps <- intersectBed(query, target, ignore.strand = FALSE)
print("Strand-specific overlaps:")
print(strand_overlaps)

# Find non-overlapping regions
non_overlaps <- intersectBed(query, target, invert = TRUE)
print("Non-overlapping regions:")
print(non_overlaps)

# Require minimum 50bp overlap
min_50bp <- intersectBed(query, target, min.overlap = 50L)
print("Regions with ≥50bp overlap:")
print(min_50bp)

# Different overlap requirements per region
varying_overlap <- intersectBed(query, target,
                               min.overlap = c(10L, 50L, 20L, 30L))
