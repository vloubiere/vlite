\title{Subset overlapping or non-overlapping Regions}
\usage{
intersectBed(
  a,
  b,
  maxgap = -1L,
  minoverlap = 0L,
  invert = FALSE,
  ignore.strand = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Query regions in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{b}{Target regions in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{maxgap}{A single integer specifying the maximum gap allowed between 2 ranges for them to
be considered as overlapping. Default= -1.}

\item{minoverlap}{A single integer specifying the minimum overlap between 2 ranges for them to
be considered as overlapping. Default= 0.}

\item{invert}{If set to TRUE, returns regions in a that have no overlap(s) in b.
If set to FALSE (default), overlapping regions are returned.}

\item{ignore.strand}{If set to FALSE, only overlapping features that are on the same strand are reported.
If set to TRUE (default), overlaps will be computed irrespective of the strand.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing:
\itemize{
  \item When invert = FALSE: regions from a that overlap region(s) in b.
  \item When invert = TRUE: regions from a that DO NOT overlap any region(s) in b.
}
}
\description{
A wrapper around ?GenomicRanges::countOverlaps that subsets the genomic ranges in a that do
(or do not) overlap region(s) in b.
}
\examples{
# Create example regions
a <- importBed(c("chr1:100-200:+", "chr1:300-400:-", "chr1:700-800:-", "chr2:500-600:+"))
b <- importBed(c("chr1:100-200:+", "chr1:350-450:+", "chr1:700-800:+"))

# Find all overlapping regions
intersectBed(a, b)
intersectBed(a, b, minoverlap = 75L)
intersectBed(a, b, ignore.strand= FALSE)

# Find non-overlapping regions
intersectBed(a, b, invert = TRUE)
intersectBed(a, b, invert = TRUE, ignore.strand= FALSE)
