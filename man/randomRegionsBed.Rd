\title{Randomly Sample Control Genomic Regions}
\usage{
randomRegionsBed(
  bed,
  widths = rep(100, 1000),
  no.overlaps = NULL,
  ignore.strand = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bed}{Input genomic ranges, in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{widths}{Integer vector specifying the width of the regions to sample. The length of the vector
determines the number of sampled regions.}

\item{no.overlaps}{Genomic ranges for which overlaps should be avoided dhring sampling, in any format compatible
with ?importBed. Default= NULL.}

\item{ignore.strand}{If genomic ranges are provided in no.overlaps, only overlaps on the same strand will be
avoided. If set to TRUE (default), overlaps on both strands are avoided.}
}
\value{
A data.table of sampled control regions.
}
\description{
Randomly sample genomic regions from a bed, matching specified widths and potentially avoiding overlaps
with other regions.
}
\examples{
# Using widths
bed <- importBed(c("chr2L:1000-2000", "chr3R:1000-2000"))
randomRegionsBed(bed= bed,  widths= rep(10, 10))

# Using a sample.bed file
no.overlaps <- importBed(c("chr2L:1800-2000", "chr3R:1800-2000"))
randomRegionsBed(bed= bed, widths= rep(10, 10), no.overlaps= no.overlaps)
