\title{Find Overlapping Regions Between Two Sets of Genomic Intervals}
\usage{
overlapBed_2(a, b, all.a = TRUE, ignore.strand = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Query regions in any format compatible with ?importBed().}

\item{b}{Target regions in any format compatible with ?importBed().}

\item{all.a}{If set to FALSE, only returns the regions in a for each at least one overlap was found.
If set to TRUE (default), reports all regions in a, including those without overlaps (see return values).}

\item{ignore.strand}{If set to FALSE, only reports overlaps between regions that are on the same strand.
If set to TRUE (default), reports overlaps on both strands.}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns:
\itemize{
  \item idx.a: line index of the region in a.
  \item idx.b: line index of the overlapping region in b (NA if no overlap).
  \item overlap.start: overlap starting position (NA if no overlap).
  \item overlap.end: overlap ending position (NA if no overlap).
  \item overlap.width: overlap width (0 if no overlap).
}
}
\description{
For each genomic range in a, identifies overlaps with genomic ranges in b.
}
\examples{
# Create example regions
a <- importBed(c("chr1:100-200:+", "chr1:300-400:-", "chr2:100-200:+"))
b <- importBed(c("chr1:150-250:+", "chr1:350-450:+", "chr1:500-600:+"))

# Find all overlaps (strand-agnostic)
overlapBed(a, b)
overlapBed(a, b, all.a = FALSE)

# Find strand-specific overlaps
overlapBed(a, b, ignore.strand = FALSE)
