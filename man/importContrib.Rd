\usage{
importContrib(
  h5,
  bed = NULL,
  fa = list.files(dirname(h5), ".fa$", full.names = TRUE),
  FUN = function(x) rowSums(x)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5}{A vector of paths to h5 file(s) containing the contribution scores.}

\item{bed}{Optional path(s) to Bed file(s) containing the coordinates for which contributions were computed.
By default, the file is searched in the same folder as the h5 file.}

\item{fa}{Path(s) to fasta file(s) containing the sequences for which contributions were computed.
By default, the file is searched in the same folder as the h5 file.}

\item{FUN}{The function to apply to each layer of the h5 object to retrieve the contribution scores.
By default, each layer is a matrix of dimensions nchar(sequence)*4. Thus, default= function(x) rowSums(x).}
}
\value{
A contribution data.table containing, for each region, the contribution scores (as list) and the corresponding sequence.
}
