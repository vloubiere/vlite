\usage{
resizeBed(
  bed,
  center = "center",
  upstream = 500L,
  downstream = 500L,
  genome = NULL,
  ignore.strand = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bed}{Input regions in any format compatible with ?importBed.}

\item{center}{Specifies the origin for resizing. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item `center`: Resize around the region midpoint. For even-length regions, chooses the left of the two
  central bases, whereas `GenomicRanges::resize(fix="center")` uses an interbase midpoint convention.
  \item `start`: Resize from the 5' end when ignore.strand= FALSE, otherwise genomic start.
  \item `end`: Resize from the 3' end when ignore.strand= FALSE, otherwise genomic end.
  \item `region`: Extend or contract the entire region's boundaries.
}}

\item{upstream}{Size of the extension upstream of the specified origin. Default= 500L.}

\item{downstream}{Size of the extension downstream of the specified origin. Default= 500L.}

\item{genome}{A BS genome name (e.g. "dm6", "mm10") used to clipped resized regions.
Default= NULL (no clipping).}

\item{ignore.strand}{If set to TRUE, resizing always proceeds from the leftmost (start) coordinates,
irrespective of the strand. If set to FALSE (default), upstream and downstream resizing respect
the strand (start= 5' and end= 3'); unstranded (`*`) features are treated as `+`.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing resized regions.
}
\description{
Resizes genomic regions by `upstream` and `downstream` nucleotides around a chosen origin. The final
width is `upstream + downstream + 1`, except when `center = "region"`, which extends the
original region boundaries. Coordinates (`start`/`end`) are 1-based inclusive as returned by `importBed()`.
}
\examples{
# Import example BED file
bed <- importBed(c("chr2L:1000-2000:+", "chr2L:1000-2000:-"))

# Resize using different centering options
resizeBed(bed, center = "start", upstream = 100, downstream = 200)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "center", upstream = 100, downstream = 200)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "end", upstream = 100, downstream = 200)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "region", upstream = 100, downstream = 200)[]

# Ignore strand during resizing
resizeBed(bed, center = "center", upstream = 100, downstream = 200, ignore.strand = TRUE)[]
