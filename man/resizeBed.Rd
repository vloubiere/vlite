\title{Resize Genomic Regions in a BED File}
\usage{
resizeBed(
  bed,
  center = "center",
  upstream = 500L,
  downstream = 500L,
  genome = NULL,
  ignore.strand = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bed}{Input genomic ranges in a format compatible with `importBed()`. This can include:
- A character vector of ranges (e.g., `"chr:start-end:strand"`)
- A `GRanges` object
- A `data.table` or `data.frame` with columns `seqnames`, `start`, `end`, and optionally `strand`
- A file path to a `.bed` file}

\item{center}{Character. Specifies the origin for resizing. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item `"center"`: Resize symmetrically around the midpoint of the region (default).
  \item `"start"`: Resize from the start of the region.
  \item `"end"`: Resize from the end of the region.
  \item `"region"`: Extend or contract the entire region's boundaries.
}}

\item{upstream}{Integer. Number of bases to extend upstream from the specified origin. Default is `500L`.}

\item{downstream}{Integer. Number of bases to extend downstream from the specified origin. Default is `500L`.}

\item{genome}{A BS genome name ("dm3", "dm6", "mm10") to clip regions exceeding chromosome lengths. Default= NULL.}

\item{ignore.strand}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the strand is ignored, and resizing always proceeds
from the leftmost coordinate. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A `data.table` containing the resized genomic ranges with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item `seqnames`: Chromosome or sequence name
  \item `start`: Resized start position
  \item `end`: Resized end position
  \item Additional columns from the input
}
}
\description{
Adjusts the size of genomic regions in a BED file by extending or contracting them
from a specified origin. Supports strand-aware resizing and flexible centering options.
}
\details{
The function allows flexible resizing of genomic regions:
- **Centering options**:
  - `"center"`: Resizes symmetrically around the midpoint of the region.
  - `"start"`: Resizes relative to the start coordinate, respecting strand orientation.
  - `"end"`: Resizes relative to the end coordinate, respecting strand orientation.
  - `"region"`: Extends or contracts the entire region, maintaining its original boundaries.
- **Strand handling**:
  - When `ignore.strand = FALSE`, resizing respects the strand:
    * Positive strand: upstream is subtracted, downstream is added.
    * Negative strand: upstream is added, downstream is subtracted.
  - When `ignore.strand = TRUE`, resizing always proceeds from the leftmost coordinate.

The function ensures that the resized regions are returned as a properly formatted `data.table`,
preserving any additional columns from the input.

\examples{
# Import example BED file
bed <- importBed(c("chr2L:1000-2000:+", "chr2L:1000-2000:-"))

# Resize using different centering options
resizeBed(bed, center = "start", upstream = 500, downstream = 1000)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "center", upstream = 500, downstream = 1000)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "end", upstream = 500, downstream = 1000)[]
resizeBed(bed, center = "region", upstream = 500, downstream = 1000)[]

# Ignore strand during resizing
resizeBed(bed, center = "center", upstream = 500, downstream = 1000, ignore.strand = TRUE)[]
